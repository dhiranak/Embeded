# Static Circular Queue

A queue is the most basic element (other than the data structure) used in static memory based algorithms. It is needed to store the available pointer indices to an array of data structures used in an algorithm. An example would be an array of linked list nodes, a queue and a manager to allocate points to the nodes from the queue and return the indexes to to the queue when the application is finished using them for now.
